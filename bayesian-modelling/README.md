The notebook files are based on PyMC3, a Bayesian modelling and data analysis python package. There is a plan to update the notebook files with PyMC4.

** Jinyoung is working on updating the notebook files with PyMC4.

Students are strongly encouraged to study https://dataorigami.net/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/ before studying the notebook files.
